## Export Restriction Russia

Russia started an unacceptable and unhuman WAR in Ukraine. Many companies all over the world responded and already restricted
access or banned Russia to stop the WAR in Ukraine, **EXCEPT GITHUB**. An official statement can be found in
[Github Trade Controls](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

Developer Erriez requested with other users to restrict Github access by Country and ban Russia without success. As a result: 

**Public available hardware and software projects can be unrestrictedly used by any country for millitairy goals as Github did not take any action.**
